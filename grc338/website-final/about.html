               <p>Welcome to Confetti Creamery, San Luis Obispo’s sweetest pink-hued escape. Our shop was born from a simple idea: ice cream should feel like a celebration. From the moment you walk through our pastel doors, we want you to feel joy, nostalgia, and that unmistakable sense of childlike wonder. Every swirl, scoop, and sprinkle is crafted to spark smiles.</p>
               <p>As a family-owned creamery, we pour our heart into every small batch we make. Our recipes come from generations of shared family traditions, perfected over countless summers spent experimenting in the kitchen. We believe in keeping things personal—hand-mixing our ingredients, testing flavors together, and always putting quality and warmth first.</p>
               <p>Our commitment to being local to San Luis Obispo runs deep. We partner with nearby farms and producers to source fresh, seasonal ingredients that highlight the best of the Central Coast. Supporting local agriculture not only ensures a vibrant, flavorful menu but also strengthens the community we love calling home.</p>
               <p>At Confetti Creamery, we don’t just make ice cream—we create memorable moments. Whether you're stopping by after a sunny hike, grabbing dessert with loved ones, or treating yourself “just because,” we hope our scoop shop becomes part of your happiest traditions. Come celebrate life’s little joys with us, one delicious scoop at a time.</p>
